## Used Packages 

* [axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
* [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
* [react-leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)

In addition to the packages listed above, I used the [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview) to gather information on the restaurants in Charlottesville.
